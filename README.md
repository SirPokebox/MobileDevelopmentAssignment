## What is the application?
I have made a Coffee Review application that interacts with the CoffiDa API.
### The application includes the following features/endpoints implemented:
- Log-in and Log out, as well as Create an account
- Create, Update and Delete a review
- Like and Unlike a review
- Favourite and Unfavourite a Coffee Shop
- Profanity Filter to filter the words **cake**, **tea** and **pastry** in reviews
- Use the Camera to add a photo to a review
- View a photo or Delete a photo on a review
- Geolocation/Google Maps API to show current user location and plot Coffee Shops stored on the API

## What Style Guide did I use?

Out of the following style guides:
-	AirBnB (1,773 commits from 424 contributors): https://github.com/airbnb/javascript
-	Google: https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html
- JS Standard (1,632 commits from 131 contributors): https://github.com/standard/standard

I chose to follow the **JS Standard style guide** for this assignment.

To ensure I was following the JS Standard style guide I used the following linter packages in **atom.io**:

- https://atom.io/packages/es6-javascript
- https://atom.io/packages/linter-spell-javascript
- https://atom.io/packages/standard-formatter
- https://atom.io/packages/standardjs-snippets
- I also used the JavaScript Standard Linter: https://github.com/standard/standard#install

## What did I do for version control?

To ensure I was keeping up with version control I used **atom.io** which has a built in Git and GitHub interface, please see commit history as proof.
